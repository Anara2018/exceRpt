Includes software to preprocess, align, quantitate, and normalise smallRNA-seq datasets","body":"## Software\r\n### smallRNA_pipeline.mk\r\nThis makefile choreographs the processing, filtering, and alignment of a single smallRNA-seq sample.\r\n\r\n### mergePipelineRuns.R\r\nThis script will take as input a directory containing 1 or more subdirectories or zipfiles containing output from the makefile above. In this way, results from 1 or more smallRNA-seq samples can be combined, several QC plots are generated, and the read-counts are normalised ready for downstream analysis by clustering and/or differential expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n### smallRNA_pipeline.mk\r\nThis requires numerous dependences that require some familiarity with UNIX.  The software is installed on the Genboree Workbench (www.genboree.org) which provides a graphical interface to the pipeline that is free for academic use.  Alternatively, development of a Docker image for this software is ongoing, if you are interested in this please feel free to get in touch using the email address above.\r\n\r\n### mergePipelineRuns.R\r\nThis script is comparatively much simpler to install.  Once the R software (http://cran.r-project.org/) is set up on your system the script should automatically identify and install all required dependencies.  Again, this script is available on the Genboree Workbench (www.genboree.org) and is also free for academic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOnce all dependencies are installed, the exceRpt pipeline can be run on a human sample (here an SRA binary file) using default parameters using the following skeleton command:\r\n\r\n    make -f smallRNA_pipeline.mk INPUT_FILE_PATH=./SRR026761.sra OUTPUT_DIR=./output/\r\n\r\nThere are a number of options available for customising the analysis:\r\n\r\n    OUTPUT_DIR              \t[default 'NULL']\r\n    INPUT_FILE_PATH         \t[default 'NULL']\r\n    CALIBRATOR_LIBRARY      \t[default 'NULL'] [path to bowtie2 index containing spiked-in sequences]\r\n    RANDOM_BARCODE_LENGTH\t    [default '0'] [options: any integer. '0' disables random barcode removal]\r\n    RANDOM_BARCODE_LOCATION \t[default '-5p -3p'] [options: '-5p', '-3p', or '-5p -3p']\r\n    ENDOGENOUS_LIB_PRIORITY\t    [default 'miRNA,tRNA,piRNA,gencode,circRNA']\r\n    MAIN_ORGANISM_GENOME_ID     [default 'hg38'] [options: 'hg19', 'hg38', or 'mm10']\r\n    ADAPTER_SEQ                 [default 'guessKnown'] [options: 'none', 'guessKnown', or the actual nucleotide sequence of the 3' adapter]\r\n    MAP_EXOGENOUS               [default 'on'] [options: 'off', 'miRNA', or 'on']\r\n    N_THREADS                   [default '8']\r\n    EXE_DIR                     [location of the pipeline, database, and dependencies]\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nRob Kitchen; rob [dot] kitchen [at] yale [dot] edu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
